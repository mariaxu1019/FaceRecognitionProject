# 🧠 FaceRecognitionProject: Automated Attendance System

This project is a Python-based face recognition system designed to automate the process of taking attendance using real-time webcam input. It leverages OpenCV to detect and recognize faces, then logs identified individuals along with timestamps into an attendance file.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time face detection and recognition
- Attendance logging with name and timestamp
- Easy-to-update known faces dataset
- Clean and interactive UI using OpenCV

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies Used

- **Languages:** Python 3
- **Libraries & Frameworks:**
  - `face_recognition` – for face detection and feature encoding
  - `OpenCV (cv2)` – for webcam access and frame manipulation
  - `NumPy` – for efficient array operations
- **Concepts:**
  - Face encoding and Euclidean distance matching
  - Image preprocessing and normalization
  - File I/O for attendance record keeping
